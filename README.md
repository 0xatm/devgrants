Hello and welcome to the home page of the Filecoin Dev Grants program! If you haven't already checked it out, you can read more about the motivations behind the program on [the Filecoin website](https://filecoin.io/grants).

**Note:** The Filecoin Project is still under active development, and the Filecoin network has not yet launched. You can see updates about major project milestones on [the Filecoin blog](https://filecoin.io/blog).

## Goals of Filecoin Devgrants

## What we fund

### Types of grants

We currently offer 2 types of grants:
1. **Requests for Proposals (RFPs)**: RFPs are grants for specific development work. As the name suggests, we are requesting proposals from teams that want to complete the work specified in each RFP. In these grants, we generally have clearly scoped *deliverables, milestones, and funding limits*. Some RFPs will ask you to propose your own milestones and funding needs. While there is some flexibility in RFP deliverables, we expect teams will deliver what is in scope in the RFP. Any deviations from the specified scope must be approved between your team and ours before we can approve funding. See [RFP submission details](#submit-a-proposal-for-an-rfp) for more information on how to apply for RFPs.
2. **Open grants**: If you have an idea for something that isn't covered by an open RFP, you can submit a proposal to our open grants category! This is where you get to be really creative; we can't wait to see what you propose! We will review these proposals on the same cadence as RFP proposals (i.e. once every quarter, read more about timing in [Timing and Deadlines"](#timing-and-deadlines)). See [open grant submission details](#submit-a-proposal-for-open-grants) for more information on how to submit a proposal.

### Categories

All of our RFPs and open grants fund work in a few core categories. Over time, these categories may change/expand, so please keep a watch on this space!

- **Core development**: The Filecoin Project is currently focused on core protocol research, specification, and implementation. Through this program, we may occasionally fund collaborators to tackle core protocol implementation work. Relevant proposals will be labeled [`category:core-dev`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Acore-dev).
- **Application development**: As we continue to build out our developer platform, we would love to work with talented application developers to build useful and delightful applications that utilize Filecoin as the decentralized storage layer. Relevant proposals will be labeled [`category:app-dev`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Aapp-dev).
- **Developer tools and libraries**: We are always looking for ways to make the lives of Filecoin developers easier. This includes developer tools and libraries for both core protocol developers and application developers. Dev tools at all layers of the stack are invaluable! Relevant proposals will be labeled [`category:devtools-libraries`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Adevtools-libraries).
- **Technical design**: The Filecoin protocol will continue to evolve over time. Several planned protocol upgrades are already being researched, but we want to find the best technical designs for these planned upgrades and for ideas that aren't currently on our radar. This type of technical design work can be improvements to our core storage protocol, cryptoeconomics design, and more! Relevant proposals will be labeled [`category:technical-design`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Atechnical-design).
- **Documentation**: Having great documentation is crucial for any open-source project and development platform. This category includes how-to guides, protocol concepts, API docs, and more. If you think we need to create or improve existing documentation, please submit a proposal! Or apply to one of our open docs RFPs. Relevant proposals will be labeled [`category:docs`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Adocs).

## How to apply

### Timing and Deadlines

We will start a new grants cycle, or `wave`, every quarter i.e. every 3 months. Therefore, the last day of each quarter is the deadline for all proposals in that wave. 

Concretely, here are the deadlines for waves 1 and 2:

| Wave No. | Wave Opens | Wave Deadline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | August 19, 2019 | September 30, 2019, 11:59PM PT |
| 2 | October 1, 2019 | December 31, 2019, 11:59PM PT |

After the wave deadline, we will spend a few weeks reviewing proposals on GitHub, leaving comments, asking questions, and requesting changes. Ultimately, we approve or reject each proposal that was submitted within each wave. Our aim is to do this within 2 weeks after each wave deadline. Please note that if your team isn't responsive on GitHub, or doesn't provide the information requested in a timely fashion, your proposal likely will not be accepted. So pay attention to GitHub after you submit your proposal!

Note that there is a chance (but no guarantee) your proposal will be reviewed earlier than the wave deadline, and grants are awarded on a rolling basis so earlier strong proposals might have a slight advantage. Of course, there is no guarantee that we will review proposals before the deadline, so it's up to you whether you want to submit early or not!
