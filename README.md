Hello and welcome to the home page of the Filecoin Dev Grants program! If you haven't already checked it out, you can read more about the motivations behind the program on [the Filecoin website](https://filecoin.io/grants).

**Note:** The Filecoin Project is still under active development, and the Filecoin network has not yet launched. You can see updates about major project milestones on [the Filecoin blog](https://filecoin.io/blog).

## Goals of Filecoin Devgrants

## What we fund

### Types of grants

We currently offer 2 types of grants:
1. **Requests for Proposals (RFPs)**: RFPs are grants for specific development work. As the name suggests, we are requesting proposals from teams that want to complete the work specified in each RFP. In these grants, we generally have clearly scoped *deliverables, milestones, and funding limits*. Some RFPs will ask you to propose your own milestones and funding needs. While there is some flexibility in RFP deliverables, we expect teams will deliver what is in scope in the RFP. Any deviations from the specified scope must be approved between your team and ours before we can approve funding. See [RFP submission details](#submit-a-proposal-for-an-rfp) for more information on how to apply for RFPs.
2. **Open grants**: If you have an idea for something that isn't covered by an open RFP, you can submit a proposal to our open grants category! This is where you get to be really creative; we can't wait to see what you propose! We will review these proposals on the same cadence as RFP proposals (i.e. once every quarter, read more about timing in [deadlines](#deadlines)). See [open grant submission details](#submit-a-proposal-for-open-grants) for more information on how to submit a proposal.

### Categories

All of our RFPs and open grants fund work in a few core categories. Over time, these categories may change/expand, so please keep a watch on this space!

- **Core development**: The Filecoin Project is currently focused on core protocol research, specification, and implementation. Through this program, we may occasionally fund collaborators to tackle core protocol implementation work. Relevant proposals will be labeled [`category:core-dev`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Acore-dev).
- **Application development**: As we continue to build out our developer platform, we would love to work with talented application developers to build useful and delightful applications that utilize Filecoin as the decentralized storage layer. Relevant proposals will be labeled [`category:app-dev`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Aapp-dev).
- **Developer tools and libraries**: We are always looking for ways to make the lives of Filecoin developers easier. This includes developer tools and libraries for both core protocol developers and application developers. Dev tools at all layers of the stack are invaluable! Relevant proposals will be labeled [`category:devtools-libraries`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Adevtools-libraries).
- **Technical design**: The Filecoin protocol will continue to evolve over time. Several planned protocol upgrades are already being researched, but we want to find the best technical designs for these planned upgrades and for ideas that aren't currently on our radar. This type of technical design work can be improvements to our core storage protocol, cryptoeconomics design, and more! Relevant proposals will be labeled [`category:technical-design`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Atechnical-design).
