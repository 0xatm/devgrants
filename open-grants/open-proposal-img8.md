# Project Description

Nowadays, more and more web3 applications are retrieving images from IPFS and Filecoin, but most of them do not need to show the original images, for example, the NFT marketplaces, Metaverse, and dApps just needed to show thumbnails or compressed and resized images to fit into the responsive UI elements, but there is not a easy and straightforward way to do this natively in the IPFS/Filecoin ecosystem.

What we want to build is providing a gateway with native image processing and optimization protocol for IPFS and Filecoin to web3 developers, designers and creators, they just need to specify what they need in the query parameters of the gateway access url like `https://gateway.img8.io/ipfs/imgcid?w=200` and it will return the compressed and resized image with width 200px, it's easy-peasy.

## Value

- What are the benefits to getting this right?

> All users can retrive optimised and resized images directly via the IPFS CID, it'll make the design and development of the responsive web3 applications e.g. NFT marketplaces, Metaverse, and web3 dApps etc. with ease.

- What are the risks if you don't get it right?

> The users need to backup or sync images stored on IPFS or Filecoin to centralized servers to enhance the end-users experience.

- What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?

> Release PMF apps on time under budget. It would be great if we could publish this service ready as soon as we can so as to attracting early adopters and more partners to use this great service and relief their pain points.


## Deliverables

- An up and running gateway that is running on multiple regions to serve requests

- Features like images resizing, compression, watermark, compositable, and more.

- A website with WYSIWYG image processor to let users check images.
