# Hedera x Filecoin

This is a Request for Proposals for projects that combine Hedera’s efficient, flexible public ledger technology with Filecoin’s large-scale verifiable storage capabilities.

[Hedera](https://hedera.com/) is a decentralized public ledger designed for efficient, low-cost transactions, such as supply chain, verifiable proofs for data, payments, advertising, tokenization of assets, and more. However, it is not optimized for persistent storage of large files or object data (e.g. over TODO SIZE).

[Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) is a decentralized peer-to-peer storage network, allowing anyone to store and validate large-scale data as part of a global, 6-exabyte (and growing) network. Under the hood, all Filecoin nodes use the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a content-addressed protocol for storing and sharing data.

Together, there are many possibilities to maximize trust for in-game assets, art, music, supply chain, financial applications, and more. The Hadera HTS demo (https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-hts-demo/) shows how HTS metadata can be stored on the IPFS and Filecoin networks, via the NFT.storage API.

To encourage new projects that make creative use of these possibilities, Hedera and Filecoin are jointly offering up to $XXX in grant funding for projects in the following areas:

1. **Decentralized Storage SDK for Hedera**
SDK that allows Hedera users to seamlessly employ decentralized storage offered by miners in different regions of the world with a reference implementation.
[First prize: X, Second prize: X]

2. **Database APIs**
This request is for proposals for database overlays to make interacting with raw storage on Filecoin easier and more efficient.
[First prize: X, Second prize: X]

3. **Smart Data Applications**
TODO - what is intended here?

### Additional Notes
* Proposals may build on Hedera and Filecoin directly, or use libraries or services that provide abstractions to simplify such as Textile Buckets, NFT.storage, Estuary, et cetera.
* Projects outside these listed areas are welcome and encouraged to apply for grant funding via the [Filecoin Dev Grants](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/) program.

#### Proposal Guidelines

We generally fund projects that can be built in a 6-week to 3-month timeframe. Proposals are evaluated based on:
* The quality of the proposal and near-term value to the Filecoin and Hedera ecosystems
* Your team’s technical experience, prior open source contributions and interest in diving into how Filecoin works
* Likelihood that your team will continue to commit to maintaining your project for one year or longer

All work funded via these grants must be open sourced via the MIT license.

#### Proposal Requirements

Proposals should include a value proposition about how it will benefit the Filecoin ecosystem, technical detail about what your team intends to build and evidence your team is capable of creating good, re-usable open source code, compelling product demos and great documentation, and a reasonable technical development plan broken down into milestones. Here's a good sample proposal.

Proposals should include:

Project Description
Brief description
Value to the Filecoin ecosystem
Deliverables
An explanation of your technical solution and architecture
Imagine that an experienced software developer will evaluate your proposal
Milestones & Funding requested
Most projects have 2-4 milestones
Budget and estimated timeframe for each milestone
Team
Roles and Experience
Teams with a history of high-quality open source software, with live applications and products, are preferred.

To submit a proposal, fork and make a PR to this repo by [DEADLINE] (For priority consideration. We will evaluate later proposals submitted after the deadline as capacity allows.).
